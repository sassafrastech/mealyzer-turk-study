<p>
  We asked other Turkers to evaluate some of the answers submitted with this HIT on their accuracy. If your answer was evaluated, you will see the results of their evaluation below. Please take time to examine the evaluations.
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong class="same">GREEN</strong> indicates most Turkers evaluated your answer as "correct.</li>
    <li><strong class="diff">RED</strong> indicates most Turkers evaluated your answer as "incorrect".</li>
    <li><strong class="tie">BLUE</strong> indicates that your answer was not evaluated, or that it received an equal number of "correct" and "incorrect" evaluations.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<% if current_user.condition == 14 %>
  <p>The number of people who gave each answer is also shown.</p>
<% end %>

<p>We donâ€™t know if these evaluations are correct, and are including
<%= current_user.condition == 13 ? "the most popular evaluation" : "the number of Turkers who provided these answers" %>
for each ingredient and macronutrient. We are also including explanations for where others disagreed with you so that you may form your own judgment.  Remember, the best answer should list ALL food groups for each of the ingredients. If you still think your answer is correct, feel free to submit it as is.  If you decide to change your answer, please explain <strong>what you think was incorrect</strong> in your original solution.</p>

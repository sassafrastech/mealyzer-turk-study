<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
In each photo you see below, a box containing one food item will be highlighted. Next to it, you will see a description of this item, and its ingredients identified by other Turkers. Your job is to match each of these ingredients to the four food groups: protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber. The ingredients can be matched to one dominant food group (for example bread is mostly carbohydrate), or to several food groups simultaneously (for example milk is a carbohydrate as well as protein and fat). The ultimate goal is to arrive at the nutritional breakdown for this meal: estimated weight/volume of different food groups in this meal. This HIT is one step towards that goal.

Once you decided on a solution, check appropriate check boxes and click “Submit” button. This HIT includes <%= @component_count %> matching jobs for <%= @meal_count %> different images of meals. Most of the meals have multiple components (for example meat and a side-dish); each job will include only 1 component of a given meal. You will need to complete all <%= @component_count %> jobs to collect payment. Please feel free to take as much time as you need to come up with the best answer. This HIT should take 4-8 minutes.

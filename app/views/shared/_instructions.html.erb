<h3>Instructions</h3>

<% if @user.condition == 12 %>
  <p>
    You will be shown a series of up to <%= @component_count %> photos of meals. Other workers have attempted to identify which of the four food groups protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber are present in each meal. They may have matched the ingredients to one dominant food group (for example bread is mostly carbohydrate), or to several food groups simultaneously (for example milk is a carbohydrate as well as protein and fat).
  </p>
  <p>
    Your job is to assess whether their answers were correct, and change any food groups you think were wrong. You will also be asked to provide an explanation for any changes you make.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need to complete all the assessments you are presented to collect payment. You will be asked to do up to <%= @component_count %> assessments. Please feel free to take as much time as you need to come up with the best answer. This HIT should take 4-8 minutes.

  <p>
  In each photo you see below, a box containing one food item will be highlighted. Next to it, you will see a description of this item, and its ingredients identified by other Turkers. Your job is to match each of these ingredients to the four food groups: protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fiber. The ingredients can be matched to one dominant food group (for example bread is mostly carbohydrate), or to several food groups simultaneously (for example milk is a carbohydrate as well as protein and fat). The ultimate goal is to arrive at the nutritional breakdown for this meal: estimated weight/volume of different food groups in this meal. This HIT is one step towards that goal.

  <p>
  Once you decided on a solution, check appropriate check boxes and click “Submit” button. This HIT includes <%= @component_count %> matching jobs for <%= @meal_count %> different images of meals. Most of the meals have multiple components (for example meat and a side-dish); each job will include only 1 component of a given meal. You will need to complete all <%= @component_count %> jobs to collect payment. Please feel free to take as much time as you need to come up with the best answer. This HIT should take 4-8 minutes.
